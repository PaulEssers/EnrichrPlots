# EnrichrPlots

Provides a function that uploads a differential expression result to the Enrichr API (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) to get pathway enrichments. It then plots this enrichment along with the differential expression of each gene, using the CellPlot package (https://github.com/dieterich-lab/CellPlot).
